## Introduction to the Project

This demonstration project will do simple conversions. In this first iteration, we will convert between degrees celsius and degrees fahrenheit (and vice versa) through a REST API.

This will be implemented as a Spring Boot application and containerized as a Docker image.

## Functional Features

This project will not require any external data sources or anything special at this point - it's a standalone service that is used to compute temperature conversions between degrees celsius and degrees fahrenheit (and vice versa).

The end-points will be exposed as REST endpoints with two functional paths:

* `/convert/c-to-f/{degrees}` - for converting degrees celsius and degrees fahrenheit
* `/convert/f-to-c/{degrees}` - for converting degrees fahrenheit and degrees celsius

Both end-points support only the `GET` method and the response will be a JSON object with the following structure:

```json
{
    "inputDegreesUnit": "string",
    "inputDegrees": 123,
    "convertedDegrees": 123,
    "convertedDegreesUnit": "string"
}
```

| Field                  | Example      | Description |
|------------------------|--------------|-------------|
| `inputDegreesUnit`     | `celsius`    | Assumed input unit. For the `/convert/c-to-f` endpoint this will be `celsius` and for `/convert/f-to-c` it will be `fahrenheit`. |
| `inputDegrees`         | `15.0`       | The actual number that was passed as input. The input value will be converted to a `double`.                                     |
| `convertedDegrees`     | `59.0`       | The calculated target value (the result), returned as a `double`.                                                                |
| `convertedDegreesUnit` | `fahrenheit` | The target unit. For the `/convert/c-to-f` endpoint this will be `fahrenheit` and for `/convert/f-to-c` it will be `celsius`.    |

## None-functional Requirements (12-factor Application)

| Non-Functional Area | Requirement                                                                                                                                                                                             |
|---------------------|---------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------|
| Codebase            | The project will be hosted in GitHub as part of this guide repository. The project path will be `chapter_03/project_source_code`.                                                                       |
| Dependencies        | All dependencies will be defined using the Maven `pom.xml` file.                                                                                                                                        |
| Configuration       | For this project, the exposed PORT can be modified via an environment variable called `SERVER_PORT`. The default port will be set in properties as port 8888. The ready and terminate wait times can also be set with the environment variables `SERVICE_READY_WAITTIME`  and `SERVICE_TERMINATE_WAITTIME` respectively, in milliseconds, to add some wait time to simulate work before ready state or termination. The default value for these variables will be 5 seconds (5000 milliseconds) |
| Backing services    | No backing services are required for this project                                                                                                                                                       |
| Build, release, run | This project will not yet be part of a build pipeline. This will be completed in a future chapter                                                                                                       |
| Processes           | The project will be packaged and deployed as a stateless container image. Multiple instances can be run without any issues.                                                                             |
| Port binding        | The default port will be TCP port 8080. No TLS is required yet. The port will be exposed via the container service.                                                                                     |
| Concurrency         | The service can be scaled horizontally by starting as many instances as required. No vertical scaling should be required.                                                                               |
| Disposability       | The service will react to `SIGTERM` by setting the replies to the readiness probe to false. Other endpoints will return HTTP 503. A singleton class will be used to check state within the application. |
| Dev/Prod Parity     | The application can run unchanged regardless of environment it runs in.                                                                                                                                 |
| Logs                | All logs will be pushed to STDOUT. From a Docker perspective, the logs will be accessible via the `docker logs` command.                                                                                |
| Admin processes     | No applicable for this project.                                                                                                                                                                         |

An important additional add-on to the 12-factor application, as [described by Microsoft](https://docs.microsoft.com/en-us/dotnet/architecture/cloud-native/definition), is _telemetry_. The application will therefore also include the basic requirements for [Prometheus](https://prometheus.io/) which will later be used to gain more insights in the running of our application. It is not strictly required for the demonstrations in this chapter, but it is good practice to start including these minimum requirements from an early stage so that you get used to the patterns.

## Bootstrapping the Project

Using the [Spring Inializr](https://start.spring.io/), the project was bootstrapped with the following options:

* Project: Maven
* Language: Java
* Spring Boot: 2.5.2
* Dependencies:
  * Spring Web
  * Lombok
  * Spring Boot Actuator
  * Prometheus

## Implementation

_*Application Design Notes*_: Please refer to [the additional application notes](APPLICATION_NOTES.md) for a deeper delve into the design and working of our sample application.

In addition to the non-functional requirements, we will alo add a OpenAPI 3.0 UI to make testing a little easier through a web interface.

## Building & Testing

### Building

The standard way to build the application can be followed by running the following command, assuming you are in the project root directory:

```shell
cd chapter_03/project_source_code/conversions
./mvnw clean && ./mvnw package
```

The application should now be in `target/conversions-0.0.1-SNAPSHOT.jar`

To start the application with all the defaults set, run the following command:

```shell
java -jar target/conversions-0.0.1-SNAPSHOT.jar
```

In order to pass environmental variables, you can also try something like the following that will simulate a much faster ready state:

```shell
SERVICE_READY_WAITTIME=1 java -jar target/conversions-0.0.1-SNAPSHOT.jar 
```

Another alternative to accomplish the same result:

```shell
java -jar target/conversions-0.0.1-SNAPSHOT.jar --service.ready.waittime=1
```

### API Endpoints

Once the application is in a ready state, you can run the following commands in another terminal:

```shell
curl -s http://127.0.0.1:8888/api/convert/c-to-f/15
```

The expected output should be something like the following:

```json
{
  "inputDegreesUnit":"celsius",
  "inputDegrees":15.0,
  "convertedDegrees":59.0,
  "convertedDegreesUnit":"fahrenheit"
  }
```

Another test (reverse of the above test):

```shell
curl -s http://127.0.0.1:8888/api/convert/f-to-c/59.0
```

The expected output should be something like the following:

```json
{
  "inputDegreesUnit":"fahrenheit",
  "inputDegrees":59.0,
  "convertedDegrees":15.0,
  "convertedDegreesUnit":"celsius"
}
```

_*Note*_:" An [OpenAPI 3](https://swagger.io/specification/) endpoint is also available on the path `/swagger-ui.html`. If you are on your local machine, just [open http://127.0.0.1:8888/swagger-ui.html](http://127.0.0.1:8888/swagger-ui.html).

### Preparing the Docker Build

The Docker image can be build using the following command:

```
docker build -t conversions .
```

The expected output should look something like this:

```text

### Testing the Docker Image

Run the newly created image by issuing the following command:

```shell
docker run --name conversions-app -p 8888:8888 conversions
```

You should see the same output as when you did running the Java JAR file manually. You can run the same tests as before to test the application.

To stop the container, press `CTRL+C`. Once again, it should take 5 seconds to stop.

To remove the Docker container after you have stopped it. run the following command:

```shell
docker rm conversions-app
```
_*Note*_: This will remove the container, but the image you built earlier is still available.

To run the image as a container with customized setting, for example a short wait time during startup, run the following command:

```shell
docker run --name conversions-app -p 8888:8888 -e SERVICE_READY_WAITTIME=1000 conversions
```

You can test again, and when you stop the container remember to remove it again as before,

In order to start the container for the first time in the background, we just add a `-d` switch to the command:

```shell
docker run --name conversions-app -p 8888:8888 -d conversions
```

_*Note*_: In this case, the only output to STDOUT will be the container ID. 


You can list your containers with the following command:

```shell
docker container ls
```

Th output should look something like this:

```text
CONTAINER ID   IMAGE           COMMAND                 CREATED         STATUS         PORTS                                       NAMES
398cc3e7c7af   conversions     "java -jar /app.jar"    5 seconds ago   Up 4 seconds   80/tcp, 8080/tcp, 0.0.0.0:8888->8888/tcp    conversions-app
```

To stop the container run the following command:

```shell
docker container stop conversions-app
```

_*Note*_: Since we have a 3 second wait time, it should take at least 3 seconds to stop the container. You can test this with the following command (assuming the container is still running):

```shell
time docker container stop conversions-app
```

Output:

```text
conversions-app
docker container stop conversions-app  0.02s user 0.02s system 1% cpu 3.439 total
```

To start the same container again:

```shell
docker container start conversions-app
```

### Pushing the Image to Docker Hub

For this exercise, it is assumed your Docker Hub username is stored in the environment variable `DOCKER_HUB_USER`.

You also need to create a project on your Docker Hub account called `conversions`.

Finally, to push the image to Docker Hub, the following steps can be followed:

First, login:

```shell
docker login
```

The expected output should be something like this:

```text
Authenticating with existing credentials...
WARNING! Your password will be stored unencrypted in /home/XXXXXXX/.docker/config.json.
Configure a credential helper to remove this warning. See
https://docs.docker.com/engine/reference/commandline/login/#credentials-store

Login Succeeded
```

Next, we will tag and push our image with the following 3 commands:

```shell
docker image tag conversions $DOCKER_HUB_USER/conversions:latest

docker image tag conversions $DOCKER_HUB_USER/conversions:v0.0.1

docker image push --all-tags $DOCKER_HUB_USER/conversions
```

Expected output may look something like this:

```text
The push refers to repository [docker.io/XXXXXXX/conversions]
7ac16bef77a6: Pushed 
0133af18fed3: Mounted from XXXXXXX/tempconvert 
3b5ee40e11ca: Mounted from XXXXXXX/tempconvert

```

_*Note*_: For the purpose of this guide, all images are published to PUBLIC Docker Hub projects. There are numerous other registries and options available.

### About Logs

If you start the application directory from the command line (not using Docker), you will notice the logs are printed on STDOUT in your terminal session, for example:

```

_*Note*_: The `^C` in the second last line is wjat you see when you press `CTRL+C` on your keyboard, which will in turn send a `SIGTERM` signal to the application. This in turn will trigger the `@PreDestroy` hook and you should notice a 5 second delay between pressing the keys and the application stopping (assuming the default setting for `service.terminate.waittime` is used.)

Now, Assuming your container from the previous section is still running, you can attach to the logs similar to running a `tail -f` which you should be accustomed to:

```shell
docker logs -f conversions-app
```

When pressing `CTRL+C`, you stop following the logs, but the container is still running.

Each time you test and end-point using the previous examples, you should see information being appended to the log output.

### Prometheus Telemetry

For now, just to test that the application is emitting telemetry, run the following command:

```shell
curl http://127.0.0.1:8888/actuator/prometheus
```

You should get output similar to the following:
